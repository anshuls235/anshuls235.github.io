# Personal Website

This repository contains a lightweight portfolio website. All content is loaded from `data.json`, so updating that file automatically refreshes the site.
The site features a glass inspired design with subtle animations and a light/dark theme toggle.

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a browser or push changes to GitHub Pages. Modify `data.json` whenever you want to update your profile, work history, skills, or projects.

## Files

- `index.html` – main page structure
- `style.css` – styling with a glass effect
- `script.js` – loads `data.json` and populates the page
- `data.json` – your resume data (keep this updated!)
- `profile.jpg` – profile picture
- `resume.pdf` – downloadable resume

No build steps are required. Open `index.html` or publish the repo through GitHub Pages.
Click the profile picture three times for a small easter egg.
