# Anshul Sharma's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Overview

This is a simple, responsive personal website that showcases my skills, projects, and contact information. It serves as an online portfolio and a way for others to learn more about me and my work.

## Features

- Clean, responsive design
- Project showcase
- Skills section
- Contact information
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Local Development

To run this website locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshuls235/anshuls235.github.io.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd anshuls235.github.io
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Offline Usage

The site loads its content from `data.json`. If that file cannot be fetched—for
example when viewing the page directly from the filesystem—the fallback data
defined in `script.js` will be used so all sections still display.

## Customization

Feel free to fork this repository and customize it for your own use. Here are the main files you'll want to modify:

- `index.html` - Main content and structure
- `styles.css` - Styling and layout
- `script.js` - Interactive elements and animations

## Deployment

This website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## License

This project is available under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
