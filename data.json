        "Focused on driving seller productivity by applying Data Science, ML, GenAI, Advanced Analytics, and BI to real-world challenges. This includes ranking enterprises by predicted growth, identifying whitespace, quantifying opportunities, and analyzing seller workload to empower more strategic, data-driven decisions.",
        "Led a series of GenAI projects to tackle real business challenges, from building the Recruitment Studio—a powerful resume screening and scoring tool with LLMs (Mixtral 8x7B, Llama2 70B)—to fine-tuning the Mistral 7B Instruct model with a RAG setup for a company-specific QA chatbot. These initiatives cut down manual HR review time, boosted internal knowledge access by 40%, and slashed response time for complex queries by 60%, bringing measurable impact across both HR and internal support.",
        "Automated an ML workflow for quarterly growth forecasts, cutting turnaround time from 14 days to 4 hours and conserving over 10,000 person-hours monthly.",
        "Orchestrated a Pyspark-based optimization of data pipelines, shrinking data processing time from 12 hours to 12 minutes, and instituted a robust MLOps framework via MLFlow to mitigate data and concept drift.",
        "Engineered a neural network-based workload index for 5,000 sellers, revolutionizing territory investment strategies and decision-making processes.",
        "Automated and streamlined the NPV model for territory investment, eliminating 20 Excel sheets and 3 weeks of manual labor monthly, reducing the computation time to a mere 5 minutes."
